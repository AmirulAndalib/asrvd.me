#Now
#### The answer to "What are you upto these days?"

After working on this personal site for like 3 weeks, its finally done now (I keep making small improvements though). I also wrote a [blog post](https://dev.to/asheeshh/i-made-a-full-stack-portfolio-site-using-nextjs-and-tailwind-366d) about it on dev.to and people actually liked it a lot. The [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/asrvd/asrvd.me) for the site gained like 50 stars within a few days!

Oh, and I decided that from now on, I'll also post my favorite song here in this page cus even that is related to **now**. The song I'm listening to a lot these days is [Oh Caroline by The 1975](https://open.spotify.com/track/14dJexYlvd3t3XAtD1pYW1?si=82758b3552bb4802).

Now, about other stuff, since Next.js v13 is here, I'm going to test it soon. Apart from this, I'm thinking of playing with [Astro](https://astro.build), so I may build some fun side projects using it soon. I have also started learning C as college has started and I need to work on DSA too.

October has been a very busy month for me and I haven't got much time for anything else like playing games or even chatting online (*sighs*). This is it for this month ig, will update it in November now. Bye.
